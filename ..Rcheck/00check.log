New submission

Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

The Title field starts with the package name.
The Title field should be in title case, current version then in title case:
‘greed: clustering and model selection for graphs and counts data’
‘Greed: Clustering and Model Selection for Graphs and Counts Data’

The Description field should not start with the package name,
  'This package' or similar.

The Date field is over a month old.

The build time stamp is missing.
