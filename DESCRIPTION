Title: Clustering and Model Selection with the ICL
Version: 1.0

Description: An ensemble of algorithms that enable the clustering of networks and counts data matrix such as document/term matrix with different type of generative models. Model selection and clustering is performed in combination by optimizing the Integrated Classification Likelihood (which is equivalent to minimizing the description length). Several models are available such as: SBM, degree corrected SBM, Mixture of Multinomials. The optimization is performed thanks to a combination of greedy local search and a genetic algorithm.
