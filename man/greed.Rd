\usage{
greed(X, K = 20, model = find_model(X), alg = new("hybrid"),
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{K}{Desired number of cluster}

\item{x}{An adjacency matrix in sparse format}
}
\description{
Greed enable the clustering of networks and counts data such as document/term matrix with different model. 
Model selection and clustering is performed in combination by optimizing the Integrated Classification Likelihood 
(which is equivalent to minimizing the description length). 
Their are four models availables : 
\itemize{
\item Stochastic Block Model (directed)
\item Degree corected Stochastic Block Model (directed)
\item Mixture of Multinomials
\item Multivariate mixture of poissons
}
The optimization is performed thanks to a combination of greedy local search and a genetic algorithm. 
The main entry point is the \code{\link{fit}} function to perfom the clustering.
