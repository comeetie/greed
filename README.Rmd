# GREED : Bayesian greedy clustering <img src="./inst/exdata/greed.png" width=200 align="right" />
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
Greed enable model based clustering of networks, counts data matrix and much more with different type of generative models. Model selection and clustering is performed in combination by optimizing the Integrated Classification Likelihood (which is equivalent to minimizing the description length). 

Four generative models are availables currently : 

* sbm : Stochastick Block Models (directed), 
* dcsbm : degree corected Block Models (directed), 
* mm: Mixture of Multinomials, 
* mreg : Mixture of regression. 

With the Integrated Classification Likelihood the parameters of the models are integrated out. The optimization is performed by default thanks to a combination of greedy local search and a genetic algorithm, several optimization algorithms are available.

Since the Integrated Classification Likelihood introduces a natural regularisation for complex models such strategie automaticaly find a "natural" value for the number of cluster, the user needs only to provide an initial guess.

Eventually, the whole path of solutions from K* to 1 cluster is extracted. This enable a partial ordering of the clusters, and the evaluation of simpler clustering. The package also provides some ploting functionality.


## Installation

You can install the released version of greed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("comeetie/greed")
```

## Example

This is a basic example whith the classical blogs network:

```{r example}
library(greed)
data(Jazz)
sol=greed(Jazz)
```

Some plotting function enable the exploraiton of the clustering results:
```{r plot,message=FALSE,results="hide"}
plot(sol)
```

And the hierarhical structure between clusters:
```{r tree}
plot(sol,type='tree')
```

Eventually, one may explore some coarser clustering using the cut function:
```{r cut}
plot(cut(sol,5))
```
