Greed enables model-based clustering of networks, matrices of count data and much more with different types of generative models. Model-selection and clustering are performed in combination by optimizing the Integrated Classification Likelihood. Details of the algorithms and methods proposed by this package can be found in Côme, Jouvin, Latouche, and Bouveyron (2021) [10.1007/s11634-021-00440-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-021-00440-z).

Dedicated to clustering and visualization, the package is very general and currently handles the following tasks:

 * **Continuous data clustering** with Gaussian Mixture Models. A tutorial is available in `vignette(GMM)`. See also the documentation for the `Gmm` and `DiagGmm` S4 classes.
  * **Graph data clustering** with the Stochastic Block Model or its degree corrected variants. A tutorial is available in `vignette(LCA)`. See also the documentation for the `Sbm` and `dcSbm` S4 classes.
 * **Categorical data clustering** with the Latent Class Analysis. A tutorial is available in `vignette(LCA)`. See also the documentation for the `Lca` S4 class.
 * **Count data clustering** with the Mixture of Multinomials model. A tutorial will soon be available in `vignette(MoM)`. For now, we refer to the documentation for the `Mom` S4 class.
 * **Mixed-typed** data clustering, *e.g.* categorical and numerical but the package handles virtually any type of data combination by stacking models on top of each data types. For example graph data with continuous or categorical data attached to the nodes are handled. A tutorial is available in `vignette(Mixed-Models)`. See also the documentation for the `MixedModels` S4 class.
 * **Mixture of regression** for simultaneous clustering and fitting a regression model in each cluster.  A tutorial is available in `vignette(MoR)`. See also the documentation for the `MoR` S4 class.
 * **Co-clustering** of binary and count-data via the Latent Block Model and its degree-corrected variant. A tutorial will soon be available in `vignette(LBM)`. For now, we refer to the documentation for the `Mom` S4 class.

With the Integrated Classification Likelihood, the parameters of the models are integrated out with a natural regularization effect for complex models. This penalization allows to automatically find a suitable value for the number of clusters $K^\star$. A user only needs to provide an initial guess for the number of clusters $K$, as well as values for the prior parameters (reasonable default values are used if no prior information is given). The default optimization is performed thanks to a combination of a greedy local search and a genetic algorithm described in [Côme, Jouvin, Latouche, and Bouveyron (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-021-00440-z), but several other optimization algorithms are also available.

Eventually, a whole hierarchy of solutions from $K^\star$ to 1 cluster is extracted. This enables an ordering of the clusters, and the exploration of simpler clustering along the hierarchy. The package also provides some plotting functionality.


## Installation

You can install the development version of greed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#GitHub
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("comeetie/greed")
```

Or use the CRAN version:
``` r
#CRAN
install.packages("greed")
```

## Usage: the greed function

The main entry point for using the package is simply the`greed` function (see `?greed`). The generative model will be chosen automatically to fit the type of the provided data, but you may specify another choice with the `model` argument. 

We illustrate its use on a **graph clustering** example with the classical Books network `?Books`.

> More use cases and their specific plotting functionality are described below.

```{r example}
library(greed)
data(Books)
sol <- greed(Books$X) 
```

You may specify the model you want to use and set the priors parameters with the (`model` argument), the optimization algorithm (`alg` argument) and the initial number of cluster `K`. Here `Boos$X` is a square sparse matrix and a graph clustering ``?`DcSbm-class` `` model will be used by default. By default, the Hybrid genetic algorithm is used. 

The next example illustrates a usage without default values. A binary `Sbm` prior is used, along with a spectral clustering algorithm for graphs.


```{r sbm-example}
sol <- greed(Books$X,model=Sbm(),alg=Seed(),K=10)
```

## Visualization

Many plotting functions are available for exploring the clustering results, and all are accessible via the `plot()` S4 method.  By default, the hierarchical structure found between clusters is returned, as a dendrogram:
```{r plot,message=FALSE,results="hide"}
plot(sol)
```

However, depending of the specified `model`, a `type` argument may be specified. Here, with our graph clustering model, a summary representation of the adjacency matrix can be obtained via

```{r tree}
plot(sol,type='blocks')
```
## Inspecting the results

The resulting partition may be extracted with the `?clustering` method, as well as the final ICL value with `?ICL`. You may also extract a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation of the model parameters (conditionally to the estimated clustering) with the `?coef` method.

```{r}
table(clustering(sol))
ICL(sol)
coef(sol)
```


Eventually, one may explore some coarser partitions using the `cut` method:
```{r cut}
sol_K3 = cut(sol, 3)
plot(sol_K3)
```

## Using parallel computing 

For large datasets, it is possible to use parallelism to speed-up the computations thanks to the [future](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) package. You only need to specify the type of back-end you want to use, before calling the `?greed` function:
```{r future}
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers=2) # may be increased
```

# Typical use cases

Alongside with the previous graph clustering example below, we give a preview of other use cases and plotting functionalities that are model-dependent.

## Continuous data clustering with GMM

See the `vignette("GMM")` for an in-depth tutorial.

Here, we use the diabetes dataset of `mclust`. `X_cont` is a $145 \times 3$ design matrix, and a full-covariance `Gmm` model is specified as a model prior.


```{r diabetes-gmm, fig.show='hold',out.width="90%",fig.width=8,fig.height=5.5}
data("diabetes", package = "mclust")
X_cont = diabetes[,-1]
sol_cont <- greed(X = X_cont, model=Gmm())
table(diabetes$cl,clustering(sol_cont))
```
Specific plots are available for this type of models

 * Pairs plots
 
```{r, fig.show='hold',out.width="90%",fig.width=8,fig.height=5.5}
gmmpairs(sol_cont, X_cont)
```

 * Violins plots
```{r, fig.show='hold',out.width="90%",fig.width=8,fig.height=5.5}
plot(sol_cont, type='violins')
```
 


### Categorical data clustering 

See the `vignette("LCA")` for details.

Categorical data are typically found in 

 * Item response theory  
 * Questionnaires
 
As an illustrative example, we use an extraction from the `?Youngpeoplesurvey` quetionaire data, where each variable is an answer 

```{r datayoungpeople,message=FALSE}
data("Youngpeoplesurvey")
```


```{r, include=F, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(careless)
nc  = 19

selected = Youngpeoplesurvey %>% 
  select(all_of(1:nc)) %>%
  mutate(string = longstring(.)) %>%
  mutate(sel = if_else(string <= 10,TRUE,FALSE) ) %>% pull(sel)

Xnum = Youngpeoplesurvey %>% 
  select(all_of(1:nc)) %>%
  filter(all_of(selected) )

X = Xnum %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x){
    x[is.na(x)]="NA"
    factor(x,levels=c(1:5,"NA"))
    }) %>%
  droplevels()
```
